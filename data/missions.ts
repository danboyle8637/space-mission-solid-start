      "Your mission should you choose to accept it is to beat Elon to Mars and colonize it. You will be given one space ship with 1000 fertilized embryos. Your team is the backup method for colonization. Once on Mars you need to grow food and setup the Terraform Bubble. This bubble is the key to your mission. Keep it working. Your timeline is 5 years to the first born human Martians. Should you need help... remember... no one can hear you scream in space. This is a do or die mission. But the rewards are enormous. You'll get to meat Elon when he shows up.",

Unfortunately we don't have a hard agreement on what intelligent means yet. Don't worry... your mission is long and by the time you get there... intelligent will be defined. The ship taking you to the Pleiades is our very best. Your success rate is 98%. When you arrive. You will automatically be woken from stasis. It will be up to your high level of intelligence (which is defined) and space smarts to figure out what to do. This is a blind mission. We know you can do it.",

Ever since Intersteller... scientists have been obsessive over the fourth dimension. Now it's your turn to find out if it's real. We're not going to lie... there's not a lot of science to back up going inside Prodigious. But that's what your job is... to collect the science so our next mission can succeed where you fail. But who knows... maybe you'll come back more powerful than any of us. Are you ready to enter Prodigious?",

This is class A mission... it's quite possible when you arrive on Titan... you'll immediately implode. We don't know how long this worst case scenario will take. We say immediately... but that is truly worst case. You need make a judgement call fast on whether life can be sustained. If it can't and you don't hit your \"No Life\" button. You will cause more astronauts to die going to Titan. If Titan can sustain life... hit the \"Yes Life\" button and it's up to you to prosper. You've trained for this.",

Elon and Tesla have proven battery technology can only take us so far. It's thought the metals on x24c89 will take batteries to a level never even imagined. I'm talking small watch size batteries that can power a country. Needless to say this mission holds the fate of Earth in its success. Make sure you watch Armageddon before launch. You might pick up some valuable mindset tips.",
